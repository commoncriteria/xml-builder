Note that TLS 1.1 or below downgrade protection in DTLS is used to notify a client that the server is capable of supporting DTLS 1.2 or DTLS 1.3, when it negotiates a DTLS 1.0 session because it received a ClientHello indicating maximum support for DTLS 1.0 (there is no DTLS version 1.1).

Verification using a conversion of the Common Name relative distinguished name from a DNS name type in the subject field is allowed for the purposes of backward compatibility.</p> <p>The client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity.

In accordance with RFC 6125, it is preferred that such URIs are presented a matching name of type IP address in the SAN.</li> <li>IP addresses: RFC 5280 does not support IP address ranges as presented names, but indicates that presented names may be compared to IP address ranges present in name constraints. If the TSF supports IP address ranges as reference identifiers, the reference identifier matches if the presented name is in the range. IP ranges in name constraints (including reference identifiers) should be presented in CIDR format.</li> <li>RFC 2822 names: RFC 5280 and updates RFC 8398 and RFC 8399 do not support special indicators representing more that a a single mailbox as a presented name, but indicates that presented names may be compared to a single mailbox, \u2018any\u2019 email address at a host, or \u2018any\u2019 email address on a domain (e.g., \u201cexample.com\u201d matches any email address on the host example.com and \u201c.example.com\u201d matches any email address in the domain example.com, but does not match email addresses at the host \u201cexample.com\u201d). Such matching is prohibited for internationalized RFC 2822 names.</li> <li>Embedded CN name types: The CN relative distinguished name of a DNS name type included in the subject field is not strongly typed. Attempts to match both the name type and wildcard specifications can result in matches not intended, and therefore, not authoritatively asserted by a certification authority. It is preferred that no matching of CN embedded names be supported, but if necessary for backward compatibility, the description should clearly indicate how different name types are interpreted in the matching algorithm. If an embedded CN is present, the DN structure containing the CN as an RDN is matched, and the CN component is further matched according to the specific rules for the implied name type. In particular, the \u2018*\u2019 character in a CN is not to be interpreted as representing more than a single entity unless the entirety of the RDN is properly formatted as a DNS, URI, or SVR name, and represents a wildcard meeting best practices as described above.</li> </ul> </p> <p>If name types are passed to the supported functions, the evaluator shall verify that for each claimed supported function, the TSS includes a description of the information used to validate the identifier that is passed to that function.</p> <p>If name constraints are passed to the certificate verification function, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the initial allow and deny tables for each reference identity reference name supported.</p> <p>The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how the DTLS client IP address is validated prior to issuing a ServerHello message.<p>If override rules are claimed in&lt;xref to=\"fel-dtlsc-bad-cert\"/&gt; , the evaluator shall confirm that the TSS identifies the subjects authorized to configure the override as well as the scope or duration of any overrides.</p> </p> The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the actions that take place if a message received from the DTLS server fails the integrity check.

If more than one ordering is possible (e.g., the order is constructed dynamically based on some property of the system on which the TOE is running) the ST uses the assignment to specify a dynamic ordering and the describes in the TSS the conditions for presenting the ordering.

If \"Common name conversion...\" is claimed, both the subject field and the converted common name are matched. The reference identifier is established by the user (e.g., entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g., configuring the name of a mail or authentication server), or by an application (e.g., a parameter of an API) depending on the supported function. The client establishes all acceptable reference identifiers for matching against the presented identifiers as validated in the server\u2019s certificate. If the TSF performs matching of the reference identifiers to the identifiers provided in the server\u2019s certificate, the first option is claimed and all supported name types are claimed. If the TSF presents the certificate or the presented identifiers from the certificate to the supported function, the second option is claimed. If the TSF constructs initial name constraints derived from the reference identifiers for validation during certification path validation, the third option is claimed.</p> <p>In most cases where TLS servers are represented by DNS-type names, the preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS, URI, or Service Names. Verification using a conversion of the Common Name relative distinguished name from a DNS name type in the subject field is allowed for the purposes of backward compatibility.</p> <p>The client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity. If the TSF supports wildcards, and allows names with DNS portions containing internationalized names, the internationalized name should not match any wildcard, in accordance with RFC 6125 section 7.2.</p> <p>Support for other name types is rare, but may be claimed for specific applications.

The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a description of wildcards recognized for each name type claimed in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.5, if any, and shall verify that the matching rules meet or exceed best practices. In particular, the evaluator shall ensure that the matching rules are as restrictive as, or more restrictive than the following:<ul><li>DNS names: The \u2018*\u2019 character used in the complete leftmost label of a DNS name represents any valid name that has the same number of labels, and that matches all remaining labels. The \u2018*\u2019 character must only be used in the leftmost complete label of a properly formatted DNS name. The \u2018*\u2019 must not be used to represent a public suffix, or in the leftmost label immediately following a public suffix.</li> <li>URI or SRV names: The \u2018*\u2019 character can only occur in the domain name portion of the name represented as a DNS name. All restrictions for wildcards in DNS names apply to the DNS portion of the name. URI host names presented as an IP address are matched according to IP address matching rules \u2013 see best practices for IP addresses below. In accordance with RFC 6125, it is preferred that such URIs are presented a matching name of type IP address in the SAN.</li> <li>IP addresses: RFC 5280 does not support IP address ranges as presented names, but indicates that presented names may be compared to IP address ranges present in name constraints. If the TSF supports IP address ranges as reference identifiers, the reference identifier matches if the presented name is in the range. IP ranges in name constraints (including reference identifiers) should be presented in CIDR format.</li> <li>RFC 2822 names: RFC 5280 and updates RFC 8398 and RFC 8399 do not support special indicators representing more than a single mailbox as a presented name, but indicates that presented names may be compared to a single mailbox, \u2018any\u2019 email address at a host, or \u2018any\u2019 email address on a domain (e.g., \u201cexample.com\u201d matches any email address on the host example.com and \u201c.example.com\u201d matches any email address in the domain example.com, but does not match email addresses at the host \u201cexample.com\u201d). Such matching is prohibited for internationalized RFC 2822 names.</li> <li>Embedded CN name types: The CN relative distinguished name of a DNS name type included in the subject field is not strongly typed. Attempts to match both the name type and wildcard specifications can result in matches not intended, and therefore, not authoritatively asserted by a certification authority. It is preferred that no matching of CN embedded names be supported, but if necessary for backward compatibility, the description should clearly indicate how different name types are interpreted in the matching algorithm. If an embedded CN is present, the DN structure containing the CN as an RDN is matched, and the CN component is further matched according to the specific rules for the implied name type. In particular, the \u2018*\u2019 character in a CN is not to be interpreted as representing more than a single entity unless the entirety of the RDN is properly formatted as a DNS, URI, or SVR name, and represents a wildcard meeting best practices as described above.</li> </ul> </p> <p>If name types are passed to the supported functions, the evaluator shall verify that for each claimed supported function, the TSS includes a description of the information used to validate the identifier that is passed to that function.</p> <p>If override rules are claimed in&lt;xref to=\"fel-tlsc-bad-cert\"/&gt; , the evaluator shall confirm that the TSS identifies the subjects authorized to configure the override as well as the scope or duration of any overrides.</p> <p>If name constraints are passed to the certificate verification function, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the initial allow and deny tables for each reference identity reference name supported.</p>",

For TLS 1.2 and below, previous versions of this Functional Package only required visibility of network traffic and the ability to modify a valid handshake message sent to the TSF.</p> <p>&lt;figure entity=\"images/figure2.png\" title=\"Test environment for TLS 1.2 using network traffic visibility and control tools\" id=\"Figure2\"/&gt; </p> <p>TLS 1.3 introduces the encryption of handshake messages subsequent to the ServerHello exchange which prevents visibility and control using midpoint capabilities. To achieve equivalent validation of TLS 1.3 requires the ability to modify the traffic underlying the encryption applied after the ServerHello message. This can be achieved by introducing additional control of the messages sent, and visibility of messages received by the test TLS client, (when validating TLS server functionality) or the test server (when validating TLS client functionality).</p> <p>&lt;figure entity=\"images/figure3.png\" title=\"Test environment for TLS 1.3 using custom endpoint capabilities for visibility and control\" id=\"Figure3\"/&gt; </p> <p>Typically, a compliant TLS 1.3 library modified to provide visibility and control of the handshake messages prior to encryption suffices for all tests. Such modification will require the test client, test server, or both to be validated.</p> <p>Since validations of products supporting only TLS 1.2 are still expected under this Package, the test environment for TLS 1.2-only validations may include network sniffers and man-in-the-middle products that do not require such modifications to a compliant TLS 1.2 library. For consistency, a compliant TLS client (or TLS server) together with the network sniffers and man-in-the-middle capabilities will also be referred to as a test TLS client (or test TLS server, respectively) in the following evaluation activities.</p> &lt;figure entity=\"images/figure4.png\" title=\"Combined test environment for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 using both network tools and custom endpoint capabilities\" id=\"Figure4\"/&gt; ",
